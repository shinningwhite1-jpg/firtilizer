## Hosting on GitHub Pages

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository
   - Name it `soilvita-fertilizers` or similar

2. **Upload Files**:
   - Upload all files from this project to your repository
   - Make sure `index2.html` is in the root

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings > Pages
   - Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Set Branch to `main` and folder to `/ (root)`
   - **Important**: Set custom domain or use default, but note that GitHub Pages serves `index.html` by default. Since our main file is `index2.html`, you may need to:
     - Rename `index2.html` to `index.html`, or
     - In Pages settings, set the entry point if supported, or
     - Use a redirect in `index.html` to `index2.html`

4. **Access Your Site**:
   - Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

## Form Setup

### Contact Forms (Email Integration)

No external services required - works directly with user's email client.

### WhatsApp Integration

- Auto-generated message includes order items, quantities, prices, and totals

### To Customize WhatsApp Number

Edit `js2/script2.js` in the `checkout()` function:
- Replace `919876543210` with your actual WhatsApp business number (without +)
- Example: `https://wa.me/919876543210?text=${encodedMessage}`

### Optional Razorpay Integration
